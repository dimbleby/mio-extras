## History and maintenance

This repository is forked from
[`mio-more`](https://github.com/carllerche/mio-more), which is unmaintained.

This library is not compatible with mio 0.7.
However, there's a similar project named [`mio-misc`](https://github.com/onurzdg/mio-misc) that works with mio 0.7.

I don't intend to do very much with this except for routine maintenance - bug
fixes, updating dependencies, and suchlike.

However if you have some code that you think belongs here, then by all means
raise an issue or open a pull request.
